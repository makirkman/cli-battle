# CLI Battle

A simulator of great battles among friends, for fun and also for picking names in a group at random.

Steps to play a battle:

* divide names into teams
* line teams up opposite each other
* every round:
  * a random warrior from each side steps forward
  * if the warrior is unopposed they kill the person opposite
  * if the warrior is opposite someone else who stepped forward they fight to the death (randomly remove letters from each other until one is dead)
* once every warrior has stepped forward or died, the remaining warriors fight to the death as above
* once only one team is left alive, one member of that team is declared the general, they are chosen for whatever task
